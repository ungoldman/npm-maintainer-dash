# npm maintainer dash

list a user's npm packages sorted by monthly downloads

very experimental proof of concept, not to be relied upon even a little bit

was working fine until I hit the rate limit :X

## sample output

```
~/dev/lab/npm-maintainer-dash âˆ´ node index.js ungoldman

## try it out

works with npx if you know how to ask nicely :)

```
npx https://github.com/ungoldman/npm-maintainer-dash username
```

(you can do this with any repo if there's a package.json with a bin field pointing to a valid executable)

absolutely not guaranteed to work

## why

wish npm did this for you! as a maintainer it's a pain to figure out how to prioritize package maintenance based on real-world usage. squeaky wheel often gets more attention than the thing 1m users are silently relying on etc etc
