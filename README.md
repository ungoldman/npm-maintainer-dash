# npm maintainer dash

experimental proof of concept to try getting a full list of a user's repos sorted by downloads in the last month.

was working fine until I hit the rate limit :X

## sample output

```

## why

wish npm did this for you! as a maintainer it's a pain to figure out how to prioritize package maintenance based on real-world usage. squeaky wheel often gets more attention than the thing 1m users are silently relying on etc etc
